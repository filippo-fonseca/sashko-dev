intro: Learn how to set up a NextJS boilerplate app using TypeScript and React efficiently.

[NextJS](https://nextjs.org) is one of the most important, widely-used, and reliable frameworks for server-side rendering and production with React. This, combined with the ability to integrate TypeScript into your NextJS project makes it all-the-more great to use.

_But how exactly do you go about doing so?_

## 1. Initial setup

Before we begin integrating TypeScript into our project, we must first set up our boilerplate Next app with the default JavaScript.

### Generate the Next app

In order to generate our boilerplate Next starter code, run the following command in your terminal:

```
yarn create next-app
```

**NOTE: You can always use NPM's `npx create-next-app`, but we will be utilizing Yarn over the course of this project and walkthrough.**

After you run the initial script, the CLI will prompt you with the following question:

`? What is your project named? >`

After you type in the name of your project and press _Enter_, you'll be good to go! (at least for the basic NextJS setup).

You can now test that the setup has gone smoothly by running `yarn dev` in your command-prompt and opening the port (usually `localhost:3000`, on a browser:

```
cd my-app
yarn dev
```

## 2. Create a tsconfig.json file

In order to implement TypeScript into our NextJS project, we must first create. a `tsconfig.json` file. Having this file automatically tell NextJS that the root directory is one of a TypeScript project. To put it simply, _the presence of a tsconfig.json file in a project indicates that TypeScript is present as well_.

How do we go about creating one? Simply run this command in the root directory of your project:

```
touch tsconfig.json
```

## 3. Install TypeScript & Test Server

### Install dependencies

Install all required dependencies for TypeScript and NextJS by running the following command in your terminal:

```
# If you're using NPM
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react @types/node

# If youâ€™re using Yarn
yarn add --dev typescript @types/react @types/node
```

Now, pause your server (`Ctrl+C`) and start it back up again by using `yarn dev`.

As you do so, you will notice that NextJS has automatically detected TypeScript in your project (due to the tsconfig.json file that we created earlier).

## 4. Convert to TypeScript (really simple)

### Change the file extensions

Now that TypeScript is properly set up in our project, we can now use it to program our app.

For starters, I would suggest you convert all existing JavaScript files in the `pages` directory of your project into TypeScript (REMEMBER: `filename.tsx` for React).

You are now ready to enjoy the benefits of using TypeScript inside of your NextJS app.

Happy hacking!

## Introduction

[Notey.app](https://notey.caspertheghost.me) is a notes taking app created with simplicity in mind.

**Live app:** [Open live app](https://notey.caspertheghost.me)

**GitHub Repository:** [Open GitHub Repository](https://github.com/dev-caspertheghost/notey.app)

## Idea

The idea behind Notey.app was to create a simple and good looking notes taking web application. It had to be easy to create notes and categorize them,
it also had to be responsive so it could be used as a [PWA](https://web.dev/pwa) on a mobile phone.

All of these ideas are pretty much fully implemented.

## Future ideas

In the (near) future there's a few things that I think would be cool to learn and implement into Notey.app. Such as drag and drop,
this would be very beneficial for categorizing notes and great to get experience of.

## Technologies

[Notey.app](https://notey.caspertheghost.me) is fully built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [React.js](https://reactjs.org).
It uses [MobX](https://mobx.js.org) for state management and [next-api-decorators](https://github.com/storyofams/next-api-decorators) for API management.
I chose for MobX as state management so I could learn more about MobX and not always use Redux in my projects ðŸ˜…, it was a great learning experience!

next-api-decorators allows me to use TypeScript decorators,
it also allows me to use [expressjs](https://expressjs.com/) middlewares with ease which isn't really possible in such an easy way when using plain Next.js.

```typescript
import { Get, UseMiddleware createHandler } from "@storyofams/next-api-decorators";

// Middleware for the entire handler!
// cors and helmet now able to be used in Next.js!
@UseMiddleware(Cors, Helmet)
class MyAPIHandler {
  @Get()
  async getStuff() {
    return db.doStuff();
  }
}

export default createHandler(MyAPIHandler);
```

In the past few years, the no-code movement has been gaining steam. XXX important mission

One of the things all of these tools have in common is that they offer a way to express automation and business logic without asking the user to learn a general-purpose programming language like JavaScript or Python. In today's world, that makes sense: a no-code option is simpler to get started with, doesn't require as much specialized knowledge, and makes it possible to design a user-friendly UX suited to the task at hand.

However, lots of today's software is still written using traditional, text-based programming languages like JavaScript, Python, Java, etc. These languages come with a lot of their own benefits: They are compatible with lots of runtimes, text editors, and operating systems. They come with a huge ecosystem of community documentation and open source libraries. Also, because they are designed from the ground up to be general-purpose, the same language can often be used for many applications, vs. no-code solutions that are often specialized to a particular task.

Given that traditional programming languages and no-code solutions are both ways to express business logic, it seems like it should be possible to select the best tool from the job depending on the situation. There's only one problem: programming languages don't meet the bar for a friendly, modern UX.

So in this post, I pose the question -- where do traditional programming languages like Java, JavaScript, or Python not meet the bar for a modern user experience, and what would it take to raise that bar to the level of a polished no-code solution?

## Syntax

The difference between something that works and doesn't run at all is one typo.
Not forgiving, and no guard rails -- to get guard rails you need more tools
Tons of syntax to learn and you can't google it or get inline help
Case sensitivity, extremely unforgiving

-> Can we simplify the syntax and make it easier to detect typos and errors?

## Text editors and CLIs

## Errors

Arcane error messages that expose the details of the internals.

## Build systems

Lots of tools and configuration

## Deployment and execution

Can't easily run it from anywhere
When something goes wrong, how do you find out?

## Testing and finding logic errors

Even if your program runs and deploys without errors it's hard to know if it does what you expect

-> Excel makes this easy
-> Light table
-> What would a programming system look like that made it easy to inspect intermediate values, both locally and in production?

## A huge number of tools to learn

You can get started with each individual thing pretty easily -- but making it real means you often have to learn everything at once. You can't just make a modern website with HTML -- you need CSS. You can't just learn JavaScript -- you need to know the edge cases of the DOM and browsers. You can't just write a python script -- you need to learn how to run it reliably, install dependencies, and more.

## So what would be the point of all this?

I feel both code and no-code solutions have their place in the future of software creation. In some cases, the benefits of a specialized, UI-focused tool outweigh the drawbacks of even the slickest programming environment. However, sometimes it might

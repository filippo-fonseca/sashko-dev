In 2020, there’s been a lot of staying at home and I’ve really gotten back into video games. I’ve been playing a variety of games across many devices, and experienced some great stories and gameplay mechanics. Along the way, one thing that’s been interesting is how different games handle the user experience outside the game -- online play, save state management, etc.

Most of the other software I use these days lives in the cloud and syncs across all of my devices. I can access my emails, texts, notes, and photos equally well from my phone or computer, and it’s simple to share them with others. I’d love to live a future where games are the same — you can jump into your game from whatever device you happen to be on, and play with others as easily as you can send a photo from your phone.

In this post, I’ll go over some examples of how various games and technologies handle this, and some of my thoughts about different approaches.

## Divinity: Original Sin 2

- blending split screen and online
- PS4 - coop - RPG

Divinity is a very D&D-like game I’ve started recently that I could see myself playing for hundreds of hours. I found it because it’s a well-reviewed modern game that supports split-screen co-op, which is sadly getting hard to find these days. But it’s even better than that — if you start a game playing split-screen coop, you can later join it over the internet and pick up right when you left off.

This works really well for a cooperative game that takes a long time to finish — you can play together remotely, but if you visit your friend you can also play locally. I’ve played games that only support coop online (for example, Borderlands 3), and it’s a bit awkward that the only time you can’t play them is when you’re actually in the same room. On the other hand, split-screen only means you can only play when you’re together. Being able to switch between both has been awesome, and I wish more games supported this.

One annoyance is that each ga

## Civilization VI

- Pushing the boundaries of gaming across mobile and desktop
- iOS, PC, Mac - single or multiplayer - strategy

The Civilization series is loved by many as a game where you always want to take just one more turn. The complexity of the decision making and randomly generated maps makes it so that there are infinite ways any game can turn out. It blew my mind when, in (XXX year), the complete game was released on iOS.

It’s incredible to see a game that used to tax my desktop PC running smoothly on an iPad or an iPhone. They’ve also started porting over the expansion packs with in-app purchases, which feels very natural. Much more recently, they added a feature which feels very “cloud gaming” — you can log in to your online account and sync save files between all of the platforms you play on.

The overall format of the game is nearly perfect for mobile: you can jump in and play a few turns, then no sweat when you need to go do something else. Civilization VI is very close to feeling like this future, with the main caveat that launching the game and saving feel quite onerous. If it was possible for the game to launch in seconds, it would truly feel like you can jump into your Civilization world from any device, just for a few turns. I can’t wait to see where this goes.

## The Sims 4

- A relaxing game that’s perfect for PS4 remote play, but sadly doesn't have a complete mobile option
- PS4, PC - single player - simulation

Sims is a classic — one of the few games that reliably gets otherwise non-gamers to spend hundreds of hours in a virtual world. Like Civilization, it would have been a perfect candidate for cross-play between multiple platforms, so you could check on your Sims wherever you are. Unfortunately, the mobile version of The Sims is quite limited and doesn’t hold a candle to the full experience you can get on PS4 or PC. Enter PS4 remote play.

On any phone, tablet, or laptop, you can download the PS4 remote play app and connect to your PlayStation to play games remotely. If you connect a controller, it actually feels quite good! There’s a bit of lag which means it’s not really feasible to play a reflex-oriented game like Call of Duty, but it’s perfect for The Sims.

There are a few downsides — for example the UI is a little small to be a great experience on mobile. I think there is huge potential though for a cloud-enabled version of The Sims where you can log into your game world from anywhere.

## Genshin Impact

- huge potential, but missing controller support on mobile
- iOS, PS4, PC - single player - RPG

Genshin Impact came out recently and has been getting great reviews. One thing that makes it feel special to me is that it launched simultaneously on PC, consoles, and mobile, and it looks great on iPhone. There’s one big disappointment: it doesn’t support controllers on iOS. I really think games designed for a controller are quite challenging to enjoy with just touch screen controls, so I hope they launch controller support soon. When they do, this will jump to the top of my list as one of the best cross-platform games out there.

Generally, it feels like a missed opportunity that controller-enabled gaming hasn’t taken off on iOS yet. The Nintendo Switch and an iPhone with a controller are very similar in spirit, but the Switch has much better games. It will probably take some encouragement from Apple (perhaps via Apple Arcade) for this to really become a thing, but there’s a ton of potential.

## Apple Arcade and game streaming services

- new platforms that simplify the meta-experience around gaming

This post would be remiss without mentioning two recent platforms that have tried to address the goals I mentioned at the beginning.

Apple Arcade has a lot going for it: you can get all of the same games across iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV, most of the games support controllers, and the syncing across devices is usually quite good. Unfortunately, the game selection
